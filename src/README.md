# What is Archimonde?

- Archimonde is a project that is used to develop GUIs for embedded devices.
- It is for non-touchscreen devices, that will be bind with a back-end program by the user.
- It is completely portable between environments that can compile C++ code.

## How to use Archimonde?

- Register your GUI one-by-one with the API, or pass an Archimonde file to make us do the job.
- Bind your keys, your signals to it, and register your callbacks for events.
- Run.
